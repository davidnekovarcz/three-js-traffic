# Traffic Run - 2.5D Racing Game

A thrilling 2.5D racing/dodging game built with Three.js where you navigate a figure-8 track, avoid AI vehicles, and complete as many laps as possible!

## 🎮 How to Play

### Objective
- **Complete as many laps as possible** on the figure-8 track
- **Avoid collisions** with AI vehicles to stay alive
- **Score points** by completing laps - each lap increases your score
- **Survive as long as possible** while traffic gets more intense

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys** for movement:
  - `↑` (Up Arrow) - Accelerate / Start Game
  - `↓` (Down Arrow) - Decelerate
  - `←` (Left Arrow) - Switch to outer lane
  - `→` (Right Arrow) - Switch to inner lane
- **SPACE** - Pause/Resume game
- **R** - Reset Game (when game over)

### Game Mechanics

#### 🏁 Lap System
- **Complete laps** by driving around the figure-8 track
- **Score increases** with each completed lap
- **AI vehicles spawn more frequently** as your score increases
- **Track has two lanes** - inner and outer - switch between them to avoid traffic

#### 🚗 Vehicle System
- **AI vehicles** spawn randomly on both lanes
- **Different vehicle types** - cars and trucks with various colors
- **Collision detection** - hitting any vehicle ends the game
- **Explosion effects** when vehicles crash
- **Increasing difficulty** - more vehicles spawn as you progress

#### 🎯 Scoring
- Your score equals the number of laps completed
- Higher scores mean more challenging gameplay
- Try to beat your personal best!

## 🛠️ Technical Details

This is a modern 2.5D racing game built with:
- **Three.js** for 2.5D graphics and rendering
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Modular architecture** with clean separation of concerns
- **Event-driven system** for component communication
- **Responsive design** that works on all screen sizes
- **Audio system** with positional sound effects
- **Performance optimized** for smooth 60fps gameplay

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Use both lanes strategically** - switch lanes to avoid traffic
- **Accelerate on straight sections** - decelerate on curves for better control
- **Watch for patterns** - AI vehicles spawn predictably based on your score
- **Practice lane switching** - smooth transitions help avoid collisions
- **Use pause strategically** - take breaks during intense traffic sections
