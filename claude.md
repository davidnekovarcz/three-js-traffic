## Recent Work

### Completed Refactoring (Latest)

- âœ… **Game Class Pattern**: Created TrafficRunGame class encapsulating all game state and logic
- âœ… **Renderer Separation**: Separated Three.js rendering logic into GameRenderer class
- âœ… **Audio Assets**: Moved audio files to /src/assets/audio/
- âœ… **Vehicle OOP**: Created proper Vehicle class hierarchy (Base, Player, NPC)
- âœ… **Event System**: Implemented EventBus for component communication
- âœ… **State Management**: Fixed DRY issue with centralized default state pattern  
- âœ… **Configuration System**: Added GameConfig with environment overrides
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Enhanced logging system with levels and performance tracking
- âœ… **Integration**: Successfully integrated EventBus, Config, and Logger into Game.js

### Previous Attempts

- User explored migrating to React Three Fiber but decided to keep Vanilla JS implementation
- Project uses Vite as build tool with Three.js v0.178.0

## Architecture Patterns

### Core Systems

- **Game Class**: `/src/core/Game.js` - Main game state and lifecycle management
- **Renderer**: `/src/core/Renderer.js` - Three.js scene/camera/renderer abstraction
- **Event Bus**: `/src/core/EventBus.js` - Pub/sub pattern for component communication
- **Config**: `/src/core/Config.js` - Centralized configuration with environment overrides
- **Logger**: `/src/core/Logger.js` - Enhanced logging with levels and error handling

### Entity System

- **Vehicle Classes**: `/src/entities/Vehicle.js`
  - `Vehicle` (base class)
  - `PlayerVehicle` (lane switching, input handling)
  - `NPCVehicle` (AI behavior, random generation)

## Notes

- Game uses procedural generation for vehicles and track textures
- Audio system integrated with Three.js positional audio
- Performance optimized for smooth 60fps gameplay
- Modular architecture enables easier testing and maintenance
- âœ… **Integration Complete**: All new systems integrated and working
- âœ… **Dev server tested**: Successfully runs on <http://localhost:5173/>
- ðŸŽ® **Test Pages**: Available in `/test/` folder for debugging
- ðŸš€ **Ready to Play**: Game initialization complete
- ðŸ“Š **Project Stats**: 16 source files, 13 test files
- ðŸ•’ **Last Updated**: 7/25/2025

## ðŸŽ‰ REFACTORING COMPLETE - All TODOs Finished

### âœ… Successfully Integrated All New Systems

1. **EventBus System** - Full event-driven architecture with game lifecycle events
2. **Config System** - Environment-based configuration with validation  
3. **Logger System** - Enhanced logging with performance timing and error handling
4. **Vehicle Classes** - OOP vehicle system with inheritance (Base/Player/NPC) + VehicleManager
5. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error catching and browser compatibility fixes
6. **Testing Suite** - Multiple test pages in `/test/` folder for debugging

### ðŸ”§ Key Fixes Made

- Replaced `structuredClone` with `JSON.parse/stringify` for browser compatibility
- Fixed `import.meta.env` with try/catch fallback
- Added defensive DOM element appending in Renderer
- Enhanced error reporting with full stack traces
- Created test pages for step-by-step debugging
- Fixed Three.js shadow system compatibility issues
- Restored original score positioning logic from !old folder
- Added responsive CSS styling for score element

### ðŸŽ® Game Status

- **Dev Server**: Running on <http://localhost:5173/>
- **Main Game**: <http://localhost:5173/>
- **Test Pages**: <http://localhost:5173/test/final-test.html>
- **Debug Tools**: <http://localhost:5173/test/browser-test.html>

### ðŸ›  Final Architecture

- **Modular Core**: `/src/core/` (Game, Renderer, EventBus, Config, Logger)
- **Entity System**: `/src/entities/` (Vehicle classes) + VehicleManager bridge
- **Legacy Support**: Original vehicle system still active for compatibility
- **Test Suite**: `/test/` folder with comprehensive debugging tools

The game is now fully refactored with modern architecture while maintaining exact same functionality. All new systems are integrated and the development server is running successfully!
